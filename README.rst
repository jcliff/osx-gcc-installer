OSX GCC Installer
=================

Downloading and installing the *massive* Xcode installer is a huge hassle
if you just want GCC and related tools.

The osx-gcc-installer allows you to install the essential compilers from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.

Option 1: Downloading Pre-Built Binaries
----------------------------------------

You can download the installers on the
`Downloads page <https://github.com/jcliff/osx-gcc-installer/downloads>`_ or use the links below:

* OS X 10.7 Lion: `GCC-10.7.pkg <https://github.com/downloads/jcliff/osx-gcc-installer/GCC-10.7-v2.pkg>`_

Option 2: Build Your Own
------------------------

To create your own package, place the Xcode Installer for your OS version
(``Install Xcode.app``) in the root directory of the repository, then open
the matching ``.pmdoc`` to build!

What's Included?
----------------

* GCC
* LLVM
* Clang
* Developer CLI Tools (purge, etc)
* DevSDK (headers, etc)
